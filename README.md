# Accessory Dwelling Units in the City of Bethlehem

### Why an overlay is necessary

According to Christina Stacy, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, the [top two issues](https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/accessory-dwellings-offer-one-solution-to-the-affordable-housing-problem/2021/01/07/b7e48918-0417-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html) of actually building ADU units is the general lack of information about them and the amount of funding required for construction. 

An overlay incentivizing denser redidential development would primarily fix the latter of the two issues. Under this proposal the construction would be subsidized or property tax breaks of equal value could be implemented. 

By delineating exactly what is architectually permissable in a city code, future ADUs will be more uniform and blend in to the character of the suroudning neighborhood. There needs to be a middle-ground between NIMBYs and a free-for-all surge of ADU structures. 

### ADUs are hardly a new feature in Bethlehem

A quick walk down Morton Street in South Bethlehem will reveal that there are sufficient examples of ADUs in the form of alley houses. According to a [presentation](https://lvrhab.org/alley-house-presentation) by Lehigh professor and professional architect, Wesley Hiatt, the prevalence of alley houses boomed around the turn of 20th century. Bethlehem Steel was at its peak and the growing nearby population of workers needed places to live. Alley houses filled that desperate need. 

Again Bethlehem is experiencing unprecendented population growth and lacks a housing supply to match. The best possible way to alleviate the issue is to look back at effective changes that Bethlehem enacted. 

The Bethlehem Zoning Ordinance has set forth degenerative restrictions on the feasibility of ADUs. Changing the zoning code would be a vital step to take in tandem with the high-density residential incentive layer. 

### What does a 21st-century ADU look like?
