## Welcome!

Hello, my name is Joey Dotta and I'm a senior Journalism and Political Science double major at Lehigh University. This page is for J25 Data Journalism course for the Spring 2022 semester. 

In my time at Lehigh I have worked as a reporter for [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/) and play [Division 1 golf](https://lehighsports.com/sports/mens-golf/roster/joseph-dotta/15792). I'm interested in political advocacy and eventually want to study law. In my free time I have written for [international political advocacy blogs](https://www.ubilabnetwork.org/blog/ubi-in-america) and built [websites for small businesses](https://mdfabinc.com/).

For my sporadic opinions of the world: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdotta13)

### U.S. Golf Handicap Indexes
![U.S. Golf Handicap Indexes](https://github.com/JosephDotta/JosephDotta.github.io/blob/main/How%20many%20golfers%20in%20the%20U.S.%20are%20scratch.png?raw=true=80x20)

A handicap quantifies what a golfer will shoot on average in relation to the par or course rating on any particular golf course. There was an estimated [24.8 million Americans who played a round of golf in 2020. Of those golfers, roughly two million carry an official USGA handicap.](https://www.linksmagazine.com/how-do-you-match-up-against-the-average-golf-handicap-in-2020/) The USGA is the governing body for the sport of golf with [statistics stating that 1.85% of male golfers in America hold a handicap of scratch (o.o or better)](https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/handicapping/handicapping-stats.html). Per the data from the USGA, I carry a +1.1 Index which puts me in the top 1.13% of male golfers in the U.S.

### A Timeline of Trump's Golf Expenditures

As a political science major and avid golfer myself this was a natural interest for me. I looked into a [database](https://trumpgolfcount.com/displayoutings) of everytime Trump visited a golf course, whether he played or not.

### Examples of Building Charts

Here is a practice chart made on [ChartBuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) that shows the three most populous countries in terms of a billion people. The data is from 1952-61

In an attempt to further perfect our skills building charts, we were tasked with creating a bar chart of data about Lehigh University's Fall 2021 incoming class again on [ChartBuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) 

![Bar chart example](https://github.com/JosephDotta/JosephDotta.github.io/blob/main/Lehigh_Fall_2021_Undergraduate_Enrollment_Percent_of_Undergraduate_Enrollment_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

Our next practice graph on [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) was to make a time-series chart on information about Lehigh's undergraduate enrollment the past five years.

Lastly, we practice creating a scatterplot on [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/) using data from World Bank. Life satisfaction is measured and quantified using the Cantril Ladder from the 2019 World Happiness Report.

We used a [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/most-bike-friendly-cities-2019-copenhagenize-design-index/) article to map on Google Maps the 20 best cycling cities during in-class practice.

We build on our knowledge of chartbuilding and created interactive graphs that compared and visualized various data points at once.

### My Golf Scores 

Using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/), I made a bar chart of my average score for the four seasons in 2021. I compiled the data after each of my rounds and stored them on my phone/computer. Each seasonal average is of five or more rounds.

Using [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/), I used the data I compiled during the 2021 spring season to create a scatterplot comparing all my 18-hole scores in practice and competition to the number of putts I had in each round.

### Lehigh Men's Golf 

As mentioned before, I'm a senior on the Lehigh men's golf and although we are technically in-season during the spring, we play both seasons for nearly a full year of golf. I decided to plot every tournament we have played or will soon play during the 2021-2022 season. Tournament information is courtesy of [Lehigh Sports](https://lehighsports.com/sports/mens-golf/schedule).
