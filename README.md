Hello, my name is Joey Dotta and I'm a senior Journalism and Political Science double major at Lehigh University. This page is for J25 Data Journalism course for the Spring 2022 semester. 

In my time at Lehigh I have worked as a reporter for [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/) and play [Division 1 golf](https://lehighsports.com/sports/mens-golf/roster/joseph-dotta/15792). I'm interested in political advocacy and eventually want to study law. In my free time I have written for [international political advocacy blogs](https://www.ubilabnetwork.org/blog/ubi-in-america) and built [websites for small businesses](https://mdfabinc.com/).

For my sporadic opinions of the world: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jdotta13)
