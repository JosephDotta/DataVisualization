Hello, my name is Joey Dotta and I'm a senior Journalism and Political Science double major at Lehigh University. This page is for J25 Data Journalism course for the Spring 2022 semester. 

In my time at Lehigh I have worked as a reporter for [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/) and play [Division 1 golf](https://lehighsports.com/sports/mens-golf/roster/joseph-dotta/15792). I'm interested in political advocacy and eventually want to study law. In my free time I have written for [international political advocacy blogs](https://www.ubilabnetwork.org/blog/ubi-in-america) and built [websites for small businesses](https://mdfabinc.com/).

### U.S. Golf Handicap Indexes
![U.S. Golf Handicap Indexes](https://github.com/JosephDotta/JosephDotta.github.io/blob/main/How%20many%20golfers%20in%20the%20U.S.%20are%20scratch.png?raw=true=80x20)
There was an estimated [24.8 million Americans who played a round of golf in 2020. Of those golfers, roughly two million carry an official USGA handicap.](https://www.linksmagazine.com/how-do-you-match-up-against-the-average-golf-handicap-in-2020/) A handicap is what a golfer will shoot in relation to par/course rating on any particular golf course. The USGA is the governing body for the sport of golf with [statistics stating that 1.85% of male golfers in America hold a handicap of scratch (o.o or better)](https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/handicapping/handicapping-stats.html). Per the data from the USGA, I carry a +1.1 Index which puts me in the top 1.13% of male golfers in the U.S.
